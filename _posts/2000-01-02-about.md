## Programming Inspiration

-----------------------------
Originally, my plan for life was to become a Palaeontologist. That probably makes it apparent that I liked dinosaurs as a kid. Eventually, I drifted more towards space and wanted to study astrophysics. This was my goal until late into high school when I found out computer science was a thing through a friend. Looking into this got me to computer science for games development. Having grown up playing video games, it interested me enough to apply for it. When I got to university, my first programming coursework gave me a love for programming in general

## Outside of Programming

-----------------------------
When not working on programming projects, there are various hobbies and interests that I try to keep up with.

I regularly keep myself involved with music by either listening to it, playing instruments or even sometimes scoring my own music. I listen to and play almost every genre of music, but I mainly enjoy metal and jazz. A weird combination, I know. When it comes to instruments, I default to the bass. Although I also play the guitar and ukulele on occasion. It's probably clear that I have a thing for stringed instruments. As I see myself mainly as a bassist, my musical scores are very much "what if the bassist got to be the lead for once" scores.

I also enjoy keeping up with multiple sports. I mainly follow football and support Norwich City, despite the unpopularity in gains me living in Suffolk. I try to play when I can as well. I also somewhat follow tennis, and am obliged to say I support Rafael Nadal on pain of death. When I'm able, I also enjoy going fishing.

Now for the interest you'd expect from a Computer Science graduate, I like games. I like many forms of games such as video games, card games, and tabletop games. Most of the games I've been playing recently tend to be co-operative. I do also enjoy a lot of solo games though.
