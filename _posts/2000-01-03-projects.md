# 3D Pac-Man
{: .text-blue}
-----------------------------
![alt text](kfoulger.github.io/img/pacmanscreenshot.png)

The goal of this project was to recreate the classic game Pac-Man in a 3D setting. The language I used for this project is C#. A component based architecture was utilised for the class layout, and OpenGL was used to render all the graphical assets and sound assets. A link to this project in github can be found below

# Client-Server Network
{: .text-blue}
-----------------------------
![alt text](kfoulger.github.io/img/clientserverscreenshot.png)

For this project, I had to create a basic data storing server and a client to connect to it. The server is a basic whois server, and the client can make requests for data and create new data. This project was written in C#. A link to this project on github can be found below

# Wordsearch Solver
{: .text-blue}
-----------------------------
![alt text](kfoulger.github.io/img/wordsearchscreenshot.png)

For this project, I created a program to solve wordsearches. With a text document withthe wordsearch on it, the program will find all words listed. I made use of linked lists to navigate the wordsearch grid to find each word. This project was written in C++. A link to this project on github can be found below
