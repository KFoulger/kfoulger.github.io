            My website is still under construction. I'd give you a date of completion, but I've got no clue when it'll be done. 
            If you keep coming back, it'll be done eventually. You can look around if you want, some of the pages might have things on them
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're someone that's considering hiring me, first I'd like to recommend you do hire me. Second, here's a link to my
            <a href="https://github.com/kfoulger" id="hyper">github account</a>
            . If you're not looking to hire me, I guess you can still look at my account if you want. Probably won't mean much to you though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Come back again sometime, this site might be done by then
